# packet_sniffer
This is a Project in PYTHON about PACKET SNIFFING, describing information about:
1. Ethernet Frame information
2. TCP DATA and Frame Information
3. IPv4 header information
It also displays the ETHERNET and TCP data but that is never meaningful to human readers as simply the binary data is converted to ASCII characters.
